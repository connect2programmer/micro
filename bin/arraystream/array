Given two lists of numbers, how would you return all pairs of numbers? For example, given a
list [1, 2, 3] and a list [3, 4] you should return [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4)]. For
simplicity, you can represent a pair as an array with two elements. (Page 128)

Given a list of numbers, how would you return a list of the square of each number? For
example, given [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] you should return [1, 4, 9, 16, 25].

How would you extend the previous example to return only pairs whose sum is divisible by 3?
For example, (2, 4) and (3, 3) are valid.
